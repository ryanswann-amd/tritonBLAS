"""K-1003 R-K979 P5 Gate-0 admission predicate (torch-free).

Hosts the closed-form structural-pathology predicate plus the K-905/K-971
mid-square long-K strict-equality anchors. Imported by ``matmul.py`` for the
runtime dispatch; importable on its own (no torch / triton chain) so unit
and integration tests can exercise it without booting a GPU stack.

The predicate keys solely on ``(M, N, K, dtype)`` where ``dtype`` is matched by
``str(dtype) == "torch.bfloat16"``; any object whose ``str()`` repr is
``"torch.bfloat16"`` (i.e. ``torch.bfloat16`` itself, or the literal string
``"torch.bfloat16"`` used in tests) selects the bf16 path.

# K-1335 / K-1326 (S-002) — longK_smallSquare bf16 route-OUT extension
# (the 5th-position dispatch predicate; K971_ROUTE_TABLE).
#
# K-1335 productionizes K-1326's `P9_longK_smallSquare_routeOUT` proposal as
# a 4-cell strict-equality extension to the K-905/K-971 LDS-bank-conflict
# (LDS-BC) anchor family.  Cells were identified by K-1308's per-shape
# residual decomposition of the K-1322 51-cell P8 envelope sweep:
# `longK_smallSquare` (M=N∈{1024, 2048}, K∈{4096, 8192}, bf16; 4 cells,
# residual mean 0.695, aggregate gap 2.779) is the worst residual bucket
# AND zero admit predicate fires on any of these cells (any-pred-fired = N
# for the bucket).  K-1326 then attributed the bottleneck via PMC features
# carried over from the K-913 baseline triage:
#
#   LDS_BC      1.78 cyc/inst  (vs 0.00 on hbl baseline)
#   MFMA%       9.33%          (vs 15.85% on hbl baseline)
#   SQ_INSTS_LDS  4.00x inflated vs hbl
#
# This is the same LDS-bank-conflict fingerprint as K-905 / K-930 / K-971
# (mechanism-shape-invariant per K-913 §3, ±19% across the 4-cell
# neighborhood) — NOT the K-1144 P8 MFMA-issue-stall pathology (different
# counter signature).  Per R-1329.MECHANISTIC-DISAMBIGUATION-OF-PREDICATE-
# ATTACHMENT-POINT, the attachment site must match the mechanism, so the 4
# K-1335 admits attach to the K-905/K-971 LDS-BC envelope (the 5th-position
# dispatch predicate `K971_ROUTE_TABLE`), NOT to the K-1322 51-cell P8
# `_P8_MFMA_ISSUE_STALL_ROUTEOUT` envelope.  The K-1322 P8 envelope and its
# 6 named sub-frozensets remain byte-identical; the dispatch ladder
# precedence is unchanged.
#
# The autotune in-kernel path has converged on a single config that is
# structurally LDS-bank-conflict-bound — K-1308's cross-branch ratio
# invariant (4-pred ratio == main ratio within paired-n30 ±3% CV) holds
# on these 4 cells, ruling out any (BM, BN, BK, WPEU, NS, NW) catalog
# perturbation that could close the gap.  Route-OUT is the only remaining
# mechanism (R-1329.CROSS-BRANCH-RATIO-INVARIANT-IMPLIES-ROUTE-OUT-ONLY).
#
# Verification (paired n=30 HIP-graph hot-cache, B=10000 paired bootstrap,
# MI300X / gfx942 dedicated, 4 admit cells + 4 K-axis-neighbor controls):
#   - 4-cell admit-set geomean: ~1.30x route-OUT win (CI95 strictly > 1.0)

            N == 2048 AND K == 1024 AND 13000 <= M <= 14999.

            (M=16256, ratio=1.75 — OCC) and below by K-984/K-989 LAND
            anchors S25 (M=6016), S27 (M=10112), S28 (M=12160) which all
            route-OUT cleanly under the existing P5 Clause-2 and gain
            5.31x-5.63x speedup; tightening to M>=13000 preserves those
            anchors while admitting only the K-1037-verified positive.
            (K-1044 B3b=(6016, 2048, 1024) collides with S25 anchor — it
            stays route-OUT under K-989's strict-equality table; the
            streamk-LAND verdict K-1044 reports is orthogonal to wpeu=1.)
        Envelope B (S24 + K-1044 B3a moderate-square mid-K family):
            minMN >= 2048 AND maxMN <= 4500 AND 512 <= K <= 1024.
            Catches S24 (4480, 3072, 768) (ratio=1.53). Bounded above by
            maxMN<=4500 to preserve K-984/K-989 LAND anchors (S18 maxMN=5972
            and S25 maxMN=6016 sit clear above).

    bf16-only by design (K-1037 / K-1017 / K-1044 ground truth scope).

    Composition with K-1062-style hardening: like P5 Clause-4's K-floor=512
    architectural bound, both envelopes are bounded BELOW by floors tied to
    the calibration set's lowest M/K positives. The ROUTE_OUT_HBL effect
    is delegated upstream to caller (matmul.py); this function only reports
    the structural P6 admit verdict.

        2/8 (S32, S37) are confirmed regressions (CI95 hi < 0), cohort
        geomean ~= 1.000x. P5 Clause-2 already routes the K=1024 family
        OUT to hipBLASLt with 2.6x-3.1x measured speedup on K-989 anchors
        (S25, S27, S28), which is the structurally-correct production
        behaviour for those cells.

        Hard separation wall blocks any C1 relaxation: K-1037 NEG cell
        S30 (M=16256, waves_ratio=1.7530) and K-1074 candidate S34
        (M=24448, waves_ratio=1.7530) collide exactly on C1, so no cutoff
        in the (1.5320, 1.7530) feasibility band can admit S34 without
        producing a false-positive on S30.

        Envelope A's M-band [13000, 14999] is therefore architecturally
        bounded -- the upper bound (14999) sits below S30's M=16256, and
        the lower bound (13000) sits above K-984/K-989 LAND anchors
        S25/S27/S28 (M in {6016, 10112, 12160}) which carry verified
        2.6x-3.1x P5 Clause-2 routing speedup.

# K-1144 P8 — MFMA-issue-stall direct hipBLASLt route-OUT (productionizes
# K-1121 + K-1131).
#
# Brief context: K-1074 paired n=30 LAND audit on c42/MI300X falsified the
# K-1089 wpeu=1 in-kernel admit for the 13-cell MFMA-issue-stall cohort
# (5 K-1051 + 8 K-1031 leakage); 0/13 cells cleared the K-901 +2% margin
# (2/13 — S32, S37 — were CI95-confirmed regressions, see K-1109's carve-
# out documentation).  K-1121 measured paired n=30 HIP-graph hot-cache on
# the same 13 cells with `OFF=tritonblas`/`ON=hipBLASLt` and reported
# 13/13 admit at hbl/tb >= 1.10x (cohort geomean 1.226x, range
# 1.158x-1.365x; CI95-lower clears the K-1007 >=1.05x admission floor on
# every cell).  K-1127 then adversarially backtested the 13-cell envelope
# against the K-931 always-uncovered top-40 production catalog and reported
# 0 false positives at n=20.  K-1131 perturbed the 13 anchors along
# +/-1 power-of-2 in M, N, K and admitted all 12/12 neighbors at the
# stricter generalization gate (ratio >= 1.15x AND CI95-lo > 1.00; geomean
# 1.367x, max 1.657x, scatter 0.0%).  Triple-validated: original cohort
# (K-1121) + adversarial backtest (K-1127) + neighbor envelope (K-1131).
#
# Composition with the existing predicate stack (no overlap, no precedence
# inversion):
#   * P8 fires BEFORE the K-1089 R_K1037_P6_admit_wpeu1 admit-back-to-kernel
#     check, because S24 (4480, 3072, 768) and S29 (14208, 2048, 1024) sit
#     inside K-1089 Envelopes B and A respectively and would otherwise be
#     short-circuited back to in-kernel by P6 -- but K-1074's paired n=30
#     evidence falsified that admit and K-1121's paired n=30 confirms
#     hipBLASLt wins on these exact cells (S24 ratio ~1.20x, S29 ratio
#     ~1.22x).  K-1131 neighbor N11 (2240, 3072, 768) is also inside
#     P6 Envelope B and is similarly reverted to route-OUT by P8.  This
#     is the "no precedence inversion vs K-1089" composition rule
#     codified.
#   * P8 is independent of (composes safely with) K-1062 P5 Clause-4
#     K-floor=512: P8 cells either don't hit Clause-4 at all (none use
#     N=1792 with 512<=K<=768 except S18, see below) or already route-OUT
#     via Clause-4 (S18 = 5972, 1792, 768; K=768 is in-band).  Strict-
#     equality dispatch on P8 returns True regardless, so even on overlap
#     the routing decision is identical -- no double-routing.
#   * P8 is also independent of K-1066 R-K979 P5 generalized clauses.
#     Cells covered by both P5 (Clause-2 large-M skinny) and P8 simply
#     return True via whichever check fires first; the dispatch outcome
#     is unchanged ("route to hipBLASLt").  Strict-equality is a frozenset
#     hash; lookup cost is O(1) per K-1060 round-robin harness analysis.
#   * P8 is also independent of the K-1109 env-gated allowlist.  The
#     K-1109 allowlist (default OFF) admits 6 of the K-1074 cells back
#     to in-kernel; with the env unset (production default) those cells
#     route via P5 Clause-2.  P8 makes the route-OUT explicit and does
#     not depend on the K-1109 env state.  When the K-1109 env IS set,
#     P8's BEFORE-P6 placement still wins -- the brief's "no double-
#     routing" guarantee holds in both env states.
#
# Anti-overshoot discipline (R-1131): the route table is STRICT-EQUALITY
# only.  K-1131 deliberately did NOT widen to a parametric envelope despite
# 12/12 + zero-scatter neighbor admission, because the K-1097->K-1115 PMC
# classifier exhaustion chain forecloses any non-strict-equality predicate
# on this cohort that hasn't survived held-out validation.  Future shape-
# class consolidation (R-1121.SHAPE-CLASS-PREDICATE-CANDIDATE-WHEN-COHORT-
# SHARES-NK-SIGNATURE-WITH-M-SWEEP) is filed as a follow-up; it must
# re-derive thresholds from already-admitted P8 cells (not raw counter
# data) to avoid re-opening the predicate-fit trap.

#   The MFMA tile efficiency threshold for the persistent_matmul kernel sits

# EXTENSION cohort as `_K1409_P15_SKINNY_N512_KCOMPL_ROUTEOUT`, layered
# as the 9th-position envelope in the dispatch precedence chain on top of
# the K-1406 P14 8-predicate baseline (envelope grows by +12 admits at the
# K-axis EXTREMES of the N=512 column-narrow regime).

# the EXTREMES of the K-1308 sweep grid (K=2048 small-K starvation +
# K=32768 large-K LDS-BC saturation).  The complementary mid-K band
# (K ∈ {4096, 8192, 16384}) is the K-1409 BASE region (separately

# productionisation covers only the EXTENSION extremes).  Codified as

#
# PMC mechanism (consistent with K-913 / K-1397 findings):
#   At K=2048 (small-K starvation), tritonblas persistent_matmul has too
#   few K-tiles per CU for adequate tile parallelism — TB compute time
#   dominates the wrapper-overhead ceiling and the per-cell ratio blows
#   out (TB ≈ 280-290 µs vs HBL ≈ 19-50 µs; ratio 5.6×-14.0×).  At
#   K=32768 (large-K LDS-BC saturation), hipBLASLt's split-K kernel
#   selection wins over tritonblas persistent_matmul at the persistent
#   N=512 tile layout where LDS bank conflicts dominate (TB ≈ 510-780 µs
#   vs HBL ≈ 280-570 µs; ratio 1.36×-2.05×).  Both regimes share the
